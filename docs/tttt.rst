To enhance users' proficiency with Build123D, this section offers a series of challenges. 
In these challenges, users are presented with a CAD drawing and tasked with designing the 
part. Their goal is to match the part's mass to a specified target.

These drawings were skillfully crafted and generously provided to Build123D by TooTallToby, 
a renowned figure in the realm of 3D CAD. TooTallToby is the host of the World Championship 
of 3D CAD Speedmodeling. For additional 3D CAD challenges and content, be sure to
